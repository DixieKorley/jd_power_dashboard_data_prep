# jd_power_dashboard_data_prep

This project contains Python scripts developed to clean and transform raw datasets provided by JD Power for two separate studies. The primary goal was to prepare the data for seamless integration into internal dashboards used by stakeholders for analysis and reporting.

### 🧹 Overview

Each script focuses on a distinct study and follows a structured data cleaning pipeline:

* Validating data quality and consistency before transformation
* Ensuring standardized column formats and naming conventions are maintained
* Excluding non-essential records to streamline analysis
* Restructuring data to meet dashboard ingestion and reporting requirements

The cleaned datasets were optimized to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability for downstream visualization tools.

### 📁 Contents

* `electric_business_study\jd_power_electric_business.ipynb`: Data preparation for Electric Business
* `gas_residential_study\gas_res_transform.ipynb`: Data preparation for Gas Residential

### 🛠 Tools & Libraries

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy

### ✅ Outcome

The transformed datasets are now dashboard-ready, reducing manual prep time and improving reliability for internal reporting. This project demonstrates practical data wrangling skills and the ability to support analytics workflows through clean, structured data.
